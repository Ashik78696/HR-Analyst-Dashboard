Project Overview
This project involves the creation of a comprehensive HR Analytics Dashboard designed to help organizations monitor workforce health. The primary focus is on analyzing Active Labors and identifying patterns in Employee Attrition based on various factors like age, department, and job satisfaction.

As an aspiring Data Analyst, I built this to demonstrate how data-driven insights can assist HR departments in improving retention and optimizing talent management.

📊 Key Insights & Features
Active Labor Tracking: Visualized a total headcount of 1,233 active employees.

Age-Wise Analysis: Developed a detailed "Age-Wise Report" to understand workforce distribution across five major age brackets.

Attrition Metrics: Analyzed the 16.12% attrition rate, breaking it down by Education Field and Department (R&D, Sales, HR).

Job Satisfaction Matrix: Correlated job roles with satisfaction ratings (1-4) to highlight areas for cultural improvement.

Gender-Age Distribution: Used donut charts to visualize the gender balance within specific age groups (e.g., Under 25, 25-34, etc.).

🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
Tool: Microsoft Power BI / Excel

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for creating dynamic age groups and calculating complex measures for attrition rates.

Data Cleaning: Handled raw employee data to ensure accuracy in reporting.
